## Running Environment
The environment is available in `env/fl_proj_env.yml`. I currently use **Conda** to manage the environment.

## Commands
There are two entrance `GRNN_clean.py` and `dpfl_main.py`. Using `python xx.py` is sufficient to begin and I have tested on *Ubuntu 20.08*.

## Current Progress
Both *GRNN* and *DP-FedAvg* is tested working, now we are finding a way to combine them.
- I have proposed a attack framework in `defense_trial.py`, but notice I haven't tested, and `parser` is not fully combined.
- Notice the GRNN implementation in fact does not claim a full FL framework, we need to test it on real FL frame and test the effect of DP.
- GRNN works fine for $batch_size=1$ but worse for bigger one.

## Directions
- Firstly, we should combine well the two parts.
- Secondly, we need GRNN to work well for larger *bachsize*. The probable ways are training global model to convergence before attack; using more complex global model; using more complex GRNN model.
- Also, GRNN relies on the info of batchsize, but the client's batchsize is randomized, we may work to keep track and see if it aligns.
- Thirdly, we may propose a metric for evaluation, currently we only have the image itself. Also, it takes effort to take out the real image and keep track of the image generated by GRNN.
